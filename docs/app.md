# Android Solid Services App

The **Android Solid Services** app is the hub of the ecosystem. It manages your Solid accounts and runs three background bound services that third-party apps connect to over AIDL — giving the whole Android device a single, shared Solid identity layer.

## Features

- **Single sign-in** — one login in ASS; every third-party app on the device reuses that session via IPC.
- **Multi-account** — log in with multiple Solid pod accounts and switch the active one from Settings.
- **Access control** — third-party apps must request a grant; you see the app name and approve or deny from within ASS.
- **Resource management** — proxy CRUD operations on pod resources for connected apps.
- **Contacts data module** — manage address books, contacts, and groups stored on the pod.

## How the App Works

When a third-party app wants to use Solid, it binds to one of ASS's three AIDL services:

```
Third-party app
      │
      │  (Android IPC / AIDL)
      ▼
Android Solid Services
      ├── ASSAuthenticatorService      ← login, access grants, account switching
      ├── ASSResourceService           ← read / create / update / delete pod resources
      └── SolidDataModulesService      ← contacts data module (address books, contacts, groups)
```

The third-party app never handles tokens or pod credentials directly. ASS performs all authenticated requests on its behalf.
